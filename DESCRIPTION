Description: Versatile method for ungrouping histograms (binned count data) 
 assuming that counts are Poisson distributed and that the underlying sequence 
 on a fine grid to be estimated is smooth. The method is based on the composite 
 link model and estimation is achieved by maximizing a penalized likelihood. 
 Smooth detailed sequences of counts and rates are so estimated from the binned 
 counts. Ungrouping binned data can be desirable for many reasons: Bins can be 
 too coarse to allow for accurate analysis; comparisons can be hindered when 
 different grouping approaches are used in different histograms; and the last 
 interval is often wide and open-ended and, thus, covers a lot of information 
 in the tail area. Age-at-death distributions grouped in age classes and 
 abridged life tables are examples of binned data. Because of modest assumptions, 
 the approach is suitable for many demographic and epidemiological applications. 
 For a detailed description of the method and applications see
